# Use Headings

Combine headings with paragraph text and other elements like lists:

- It's super quick.
- It's super easy.

---

# Paragraphs

Use a blank line in between text to start a new paragraph.

You can include a paragraph break by leaving an empty line between the paragraphs.
Otherwise lines will follow on directly like this.
